this is a work in progress, if you find bugs and you will, please report them :)

currently unsupported features:
    external actual lexer
    more advanced grammars than slr (planning to eventually support lalr)
    matching literals with more than 1 char (this is trivial)

*peacfully deal with unsupported grammars
    currently undefined things happen, undefined as in infinite loops or errors
    but an unsupported grammar should not be accepted :)
