currently there are two source files to deal with:
    lrgen.py: 
        this is does more abstract things like parsing the input grammar and generating a table
        you can use it like this:
        lrgen.py -v --in<grammar_file>
        to get the states table
    generate_slr_c.py: 
        this generates a C implementation of a parser, see the arithmetic example
